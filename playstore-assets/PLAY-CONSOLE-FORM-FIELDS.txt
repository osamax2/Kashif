# Financial Features (Step 1 of 2)

## Does your app provide any financial features?

☐ Banking and loans
☐ Payments and transfers
☐ Purchase agreements (Rewards, points, BNPL)
☐ Trading and funds
☐ Support services
☐ Other

☑ **My app doesn't provide any financial features** ✓

**Reasoning:**
- App has a **gamification points system** (like game achievements), NOT a financial rewards program
- No real money involved - points are virtual and cannot be converted to cash
- No in-app purchases or payment processing
- Coupons are promotional discount codes only (no purchases made through app)
- No financial transactions of any kind

**Important distinction:**
- Kashif's points = Game score/achievements (like collecting stars in a game)
- Financial rewards = Cash, gift cards, cryptocurrency, transferable value
- Our coupons = Discount codes shown to users (like a coupon app)
- Financial purchase agreements = Buy now pay later, loyalty programs with monetary value

---

# Policy Declarations

## Advertising ID Declaration

**Required for apps targeting Android 13+**

### Does your app use Advertising ID?

**Answer: NO** ✓

**Explanation:**
- App does NOT display any advertisements
- App does NOT use Google Ads, AdMob, or any ad networks
- App does NOT use Advertising ID for tracking or analytics
- App does NOT share Advertising ID with third parties
- App uses FCM device tokens ONLY for push notifications (not advertising)

---

# Health Features Declaration

## Does your app have any health features?

☐ Health and fitness

☐ Other

☑ **My app does not have any health features** ✓

**Important distinction:**
- Kashif's "safety" = Traffic/road safety (avoiding potholes, road damage)
- Health "safety" = Medical emergencies, first aid, health conditions

- Health alerts = Medical symptoms, vital signs, health monitoring

**App Category:** Maps & Navigation / Utility
**NOT:** Health & Fitness / Medical
